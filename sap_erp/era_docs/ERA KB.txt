2. Under what situations must an ERA agent declare conflicts of interest?

Answer:
An ERA agent must declare a conflict of interest before representing any party when any of the following applies:

The agent has a personal interest in the transaction (e.g., is the owner, buyer, or related to involved parties).

The agent receives benefits beyond standard commission (e.g., incentives from a developer).
